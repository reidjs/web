    <p class="card-text">It's such a drag to have to open a new window and check if a movie or TV show is on Netflix Streaming,
    so this bot will magically tell you! It uses the NetflixRoulette and praw APIs to crawl through reddit for content titles,
    then replies when it finds one. Write-up with code coming soon.
